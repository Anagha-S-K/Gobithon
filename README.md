This project is a parcel management and notification system that helps individuals securely receive their mail and packages when they are unavailable. It streamlines the process of tracking, storing, and retrieving parcels efficiently.

How It Works:
1️⃣ Parcel Check-in – When a parcel arrives, the system captures the mailbox number and extracts the tracking ID.
2️⃣ Recipient Identification – It searches the database to find the recipient’s email ID.
3️⃣ Ticket Generation – A ticket with a unique barcode and mailbox number is created and placed in the respective mailbox.
4️⃣ Email Notification – The recipient receives an email with details to collect their parcel.
5️⃣ Parcel Pickup – The recipient retrieves the ticket from their mailbox and presents it to claim their parcel.
6️⃣ Confirmation Email – A follow-up email is sent to confirm successful parcel collection.

The system ensures a secure, organized, and automated process for managing parcels, reducing misplacements and enhancing user convenience.
